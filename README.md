# Algorithms
This respository is a collection of various useful algorithms and data structures along with their Java implementations, intended for educational use. This is a work in progress, so some algorithms may not be included. All files that have been added have been tested extensively and should be accurate, readable, and efficient. Feel free to suggest any algorithms that you'd like to see implemented in the future. Don't hesitate to contact me with any questions, concerns, or feedback (my contact information is at the bottom of this file). If you found this repository helpful, I'd love to know :)

# Additional Resources
If you're interested in expanding your knowledge of algorithms, I've included a list of resources that you can take a look at.

## Books
Some helpful books to formally introduce algorithims:
* [Introduction to Algorithms (CLRS)](https://web.njit.edu/~wl256/download/cs610/Introduction-to-algorithm-3rdEdition.pdf) by Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, Stein - Standard text for introductory algorithms courses; proof-based, very rigorous, comprehensive explanations.
* [The Art of Computer Programming](https://www.amazon.com/Computer-Programming-Volumes-1-4A-Boxed/dp/0321751043) by Knuth - Extremely high level, incredibly detailed text; should be used primarily as a reference.
* [Algorithms Unlocked](https://book-store.github.io/cse/thirdyear/[Thomas_H._Cormen]_Algorithms_unlocked(BookZZ.org).pdf) by Cormen - More accessible, beginner-friendly text; read this if you find CLRS too daunting.

## Websites
